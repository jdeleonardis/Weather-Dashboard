## Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 6 - Weather Dashboard.  The assignment was to create a weather dashboard that uses a weather api, builds the current weather and 5 day forecast dynamically, as well as save the cities searched.

The dashboard should:
* Allow the user to enter the name of a city.  When they do, the city's current forecast should be displayed, as well as the 5 day forecast.
* When the user searches for a city's weather, the city should be saved in local storage as history.  The history should be saved in a clickable list.  When the user clicks on a city that was already searched, it should retrieve the weather.  Additionally, the last city searched should be saved locally.  When the app opens, if any cities had been previously searched, the app should automatically open that city's weather
* Weather should contain icons representing the weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed
* The UV value returned should be color coded based on the UV index


### Extra Information
* No code was given for this project and all was created from scratch.  I used the bootstrap grid system to build the site.
* The current weather is a bootstrap card.  Additionally, the 5 days forecast are 5 bootstrap cards.
* The search button/icon came from Fontawesome.com.
